# generator-air-game
An AIR for Mobile game project generator to speed up the standard classes I keep recreating with each project.

## Installation
Install yeoman globally as you normally would:
```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Next, install this generator:
```
$ npm install -g generator-air-game

Run the generator in any empty directory to scaffold your game!
Dependencies will be automatically installed after scaffolding.
```
$ mkdir MyGame
$ cd MyGame
$ yo air-game
```

## Running
You will need to create Game.fla file and have Main class be the Doc class.
I am working on including the sample run project
